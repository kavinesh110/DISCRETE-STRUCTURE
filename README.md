<h1>DISCRETE STRUCTURE</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
The Discrete Structures course has deepened my understanding of the mathematical foundations of computer science. I gained valuable skills in logic, proof techniques, set theory, relations, and functions, which are essential for problem-solving and algorithm design.
I particularly enjoyed learning graph theory and its applications in modeling real-world problems, as well as combinatorics and recurrence relations, which enhanced my analytical thinking. This course has strengthened my logical reasoning and prepared me to tackle advanced topics like data structures, algorithms, and cryptography.Overall, this course has been both challenging and rewarding, providing me with tools to approach computational problems effectively.
